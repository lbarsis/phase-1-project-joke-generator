# Joke Generator Summary
This project searches through the public API, https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/, and returns 10 random, safe-for-work jokes.

## Use of Application
The idea of this project is to allow users to search the public API for jokes that can be shared in public spaces. Users will have the option to apply filters that include category and search for specific keywords in the description.

Once the page loads, you will see a search bar with a series of filter. The search bare and filters are of course optional, but may help narrow down the results if you are looking for a specific type of joke. Once the filters are input, click the search button. This will return a list of 10 random jokes that meet your search criteria.
